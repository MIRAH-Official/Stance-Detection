## STEDUCOV: A DATASET ON STANCE DETECTION IN TWEETS TOWARDS ONLINE EDUCATION DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC
 
## Abstract
StEduCov, a dataset annotated for stances toward online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. StEduCov has 17,097 tweets gathered over 15 months, from March 2020 to May 2021, using Twitter API. The tweets are manually annotated into agree, disagree or neutral classes. We used a set of relevant hashtags and keywords. Specifically, we utilised a combination of hashtags, such as '#COVID 19' or '#Coronavirus' with keywords, such as 'education', 'online learning', 'distance learning' and 'remote learning'. To ensure high annotation quality, three different annotators annotated each tweet and at least one of the reviewers from three judges revised it. They were guided by some instructions, such as that in the case of disagree class, there should be a clear negative statement about online education or its impact. Also, if the tweet is negative but refers to other people (e.g. 'my children hate online learning').




This dataset was introduced in the paper titled [**StEduCov: An Explored and Benchmarked Dataset on Stance Detection in Tweets towards Online Education during COVID-19 Pandemic**](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/3/88), published in the ***Big Data and Cognitive Computing Journal***
